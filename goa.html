The state of Goa, India, is famous for its beaches and places of worship, and tourism is its primary
industry. Tourism is generally focused on the coastal areas of Goa, with decreased tourist activity
inland. Foreign tourists, mostly from Europe, arrive in Goa in winter whilst the summer and monsoon
seasons see a large number of Indian tourists.This relatively small state is situated on the western
coast of India, between the borders of Maharashtra and Karnataka and is better known to the world as
a former Portuguese enclave on Indian soil. Tourism is said to be the backbone of Goa's economy.
<br>
Major tourist attractions include: 
<font color=red>Bom Jesus Basilica, Fort Aguada, a wax museum on Indian culture and a heritage museum. 
The Churches and Convents of Goa have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.</font><br>
